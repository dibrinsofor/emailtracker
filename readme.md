### How to use (after forking repo):
1. create a `.env` file and copy paste the sample text from the `.env_sample` file.
2. enter newly generated third party app password from email client for added security (or you can just use your regular email and password).
3. navigate to the file's location and run the script from terminal using `python testimap.py`.
4. after running successfully, open `email_dump.txt` to see generated email data.
